3. Based on the location find whats the [wheather](https://www.metaweather.com/api/) there
4. Get the time based on location
5. Create tags based on the weather and time of day
6. Make an api call to find photos: [here](https://github.com/500px/legacy-api-documentation), [here](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/), [here](developers.gettyimages.com/en/), or find something on the this [list](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis#photography) based on the tags (select a random photo from results).
7. Make a call to the invironment (KDE, Gnome) and change the wallpaper with the selected photo
